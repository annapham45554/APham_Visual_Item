# Visual Item - Project Description
### Anna Pham | DES 427 | Fall 2024
<p>I put some cat GIFs, a birthday card GIF, and a cat meow sound in the preload() function so everything is ready before the sketch runs. The loadImage() and loadSound() functions are used to load the GIF and audio files. In the draw() function, I check if catDisplayed is true using an if-else statement. If it is true, the cat GIF is displayed; otherwise, the birthday card GIF is shown. When I click the mouse (mousePressed), a new random cat GIF pops up, and if I press any key (keyPressed), the meow audio plays.<p>
